Duchess is a Rust crate that makes it easy, ergonomic, and efficient to interoperate with Java code.

## TL;DR

Duchess permits you to reflect Java classes into Rust and easily invoke methods on Java objects. For example the following Java code...

```rust
Logger logger = new log.Logger();
logger.addEvent(
    Event.builder()
        .withTime(new Date())
        .withName("foo")
        .build()
);
```

...could be executed in Rust as follows:

```rust
let logger = log::Logger::new().execute()?;
logger
    .add_event(
        log::Event::builder()
            .with_time(java::util::Date::new())
            .with_name("foo")
            .build(),
    )
    .execute()?;
```
